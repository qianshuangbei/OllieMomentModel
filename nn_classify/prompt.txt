prompt:
Design a model to do classification, label file is data/label.txt label file format: pose_file_path label_id. There are 3 labels: 0,1,2 pose file format: keypoint_id\tx\ty\tconf. There are 17 keypoint and 3 paramter, 17*3=51, and for each file, there are 4 group number. if there is less than 4 groups. padding with 0. each pose file can generate feature as [51,4]

let Batch_size = 16. 
Use SGD or Adam as loss function, 
Use warm up and Learning rate decay. 
Save the model for every 10 epoch, run 100 epoch. 
print the loss and acc. 90% data as training, 10% data as dev. 
Write the training code and eval code.
